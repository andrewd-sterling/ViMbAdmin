{"name":"ViMbAdmin","body":"![ViMbAdmin Logo](https://github.com/opensolutions/ViMbAdmin/blob/develop/data/logo/logo_500x159.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nViMbAdmin (pronounced vim-be-admin and meaning Virtual Mailbox Administration) is intended as an alternative to (and a near slot in replacement) for the popular but dated Postfix Admin application.\r\n\r\nIt has been developed by [Open Solutions](http://www.opensolutions.ie/), a company based in Dublin, Ireland specialising in PHP web application development, Linux and UNIX system administration and ISP grade networking and we are releasing it under a GPL V3 license. It is written in PHP using the [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/), [Doctrine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) with [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/) on the frontend.\r\n\r\nIf you find this software useful, please consider making a donation to our [chosen charity](http://www.opensolutions.ie/open-source/vimbadmin).\r\n\r\n## Live Demo and Screenshots\r\n\r\nWe run a live demo which resets every two hours at: http://www.opensolutions.ie/vimbadmin/\r\n\r\nYou can browse screenshots at: http://www.opensolutions.ie/open-source/vimbadmin/\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* [Change Log](https://github.com/opensolutions/ViMbAdmin/blob/master/CHANGELOG)\r\n* [Updating](https://github.com/opensolutions/ViMbAdmin/blob/master/UPDATING)\r\n* Installation from packages: [[Installation Instructions]]\r\n* Installation from Git: [[Install Using Git]]\r\n* Migrate from Postfix Admin: [[Migrate From PostfixAdmin]]\r\n* Migrate from Postfix Admin: [[Postfix and MySQL Integration]]\r\n\r\n## Community and Discussion\r\n\r\nWe have a mailing list for discussion on Google Groups where the developers are also present:\r\n\r\n* http://groups.google.com/group/vimbadmin-discuss\r\n\r\nLatest news is posted at:\r\n\r\n* http://www.opensolutions.ie/blog/category/vimbadmin/ ([RSS feed](http://www.opensolutions.ie/blog/category/vimbadmin/feed/))\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* a mail server such as Postfix which supports virtual domains and mailboxes;\r\n* a compatible IMAP/POP3 server (such as Dovecot and Courier)\r\n* a Doctrine / PDO supported database (which includes MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, InterBase?, Firebird, SQLite;\r\n* PHP v5;\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nStandard and enhanced features from Postfix Admin include:\r\n\r\n* Super admin(s) user level with full access;\r\n* Admin(s) user level with access only to assigned domains and their mailboxes and aliases;\r\n* Super admins can create and modify super admins and admins;\r\n* [JQuery Datatable](http://www.datatables.net/) throughout for quick in browser searching and pagination;\r\n* Create, modify and purge domains including limited the number of mailboxes and aliases a non-super admin can create per-domain;\r\n* Activate / deactivate admins, domains, mailboxes and aliases at the click of a button;\r\n* Full logging;\r\n* Facility for users (mailbox owners) to change their password;\r\n* Unlike Postfix Admin, ViMbAdmin has a single login point for all administrators whether super or not.\r\n\r\nAdditional features include:\r\n\r\n* Very configurable including:\r\n  * set default values for quotas, number of mailboxes and aliases for domain creation;\r\n  * added additional columns to the mailbox schema (including UID, GID, homedir and maildir);\r\n  * templated welcome and settings email for users;\r\n* either plain or MD5 mailbox password support;\r\n* admin users table is secured with salted SHA passwords;\r\n* Forgotten Password / Password Reset function for admins;\r\n\r\n## Compatibility with Postfix Admin\r\n\r\nWe have for the most part stuck with Postfix Admin's database structure (domains, admins, domain admins, mailboxes and aliases) with small changes such as the addition of an integer primary key. Some simple SQL statements in the installation will quickly convert your existing database for use.\r\n\r\nAlmost all features (and some additions) are included with the exception of vacation support. All contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information and Feedback\r\n\r\nOur development process has not ended on this but we have completed the majority of features we require. Please contact us if you would like to contribute to additional development (either by coding or enticing us with a donation to our chosen charity).\r\n\r\nWe will create (and we welcome) how to documents on setting up mail platforms using ViMbAdmin. For now, existing Postfix Admin how to documents will be compatible.\r\n\r\n## Logo\r\n\r\nThe nerds at [Limeworks Australia](http://www.limeworks.com.au/) designed and contributed a super logo (see [this source directory](https://github.com/opensolutions/ViMbAdmin/tree/master/data/logo)) to the project which we now display with pride.\r\n\r\nThere are various sizes available which people can freely use so long as they link back to this project.","tagline":"Virtual Mailbox Administration","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
